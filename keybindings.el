; key map preference, from the Emacs manual....
; Usually, the active keymaps are:
;   (i) the keymap specified by the keymap property,
;   (ii) the keymaps of enabled minor modes,
;   (iii) the current bufferâ€™s local keymap, and
;   (iv) the global keymap, in that order.
; Emacs searches for each input key sequence in all these keymaps.
;
; (iii) the local keymap is usually set by the major mode, and is shared by all buffers in the same major mode
; (iv) the global keymap exists in variable global-map
